# Note Taking App
by. SeHee

Goal
- Duration : 2hrs
- Render a list of notes onto a web page.
- Allow the user to create new notes in the user interface (UI).
- Add the ability for a user to Edit and Delete notes in the UI.
- Add persistent storage to your application using a relational database (e.g. SQLite).
- Add the concept of users. Allow a user to “login” (with just a username, don’t worry about a password)
- When a user creates a note, that note is associated with their username.
- Users should not be able to see each others’ notes.
- You don’t need to create a User models in the database, rather, you can just add a column to your Notes table that stores the username of who created the note.
